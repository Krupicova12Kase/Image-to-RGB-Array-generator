# RGB Array Generator

Simple tool for generating arrays with RGB data from an image. Made for [Astro pi: Mission zero](https://astro-pi.org/mission-zero), but probably will work for other stuff too.

## How to use

1. Download main.py
2. Place your image **in the same folder as main.py**
3. Run main.py
4. Type-in file name **and extension**
5. Copy results wherever you want!
